# PyPI Upload Checklist for Eve Online Crash Monitor v1.1.0

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### Original Problem
- `pywin32>=306` dependency was failing on GitHub Actions Linux runners
- `pip-compile` couldn't resolve Windows-specific packages on non-Windows systems
- PyPI upload workflow was broken due to platform incompatibility

### Solution Applied
- Updated `requirements.txt` with platform-specific markers
- Added proper Python packaging configuration
- Created cross-platform GitHub Actions workflow

## âœ… Files Created/Updated

### Core Package Files
- [x] `requirements.txt` - Updated with `pywin32>=306; sys_platform == "win32"`
- [x] `pyproject.toml` - Modern Python packaging configuration
- [x] `setup.py` - Backwards compatibility packaging
- [x] `MANIFEST.in` - Package file inclusion rules
- [x] `LICENSE` - MIT license for PyPI compliance

### Development Files  
- [x] `requirements-dev.txt` - CI/CD dependencies (excludes Windows-only packages)
- [x] `.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml` - GitHub Actions for PyPI publishing

## âœ… Package Verification

### Build Status
- [x] Package builds successfully: `eve_crash_monitor-1.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`
- [x] Twine validation passes: `PASSED`
- [x] No critical warnings in build process
- [x] License configuration updated to modern format

### Platform Compatibility
- [x] Windows: `pywin32>=306` will install (sys_platform == "win32")
- [x] Linux/macOS: `pywin32>=306` will be skipped gracefully
- [x] Core dependency `psutil>=5.9.0` works on all platforms

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for GitHub Upload

### 1. Commit Changes
```bash
git add requirements.txt pyproject.toml setup.py MANIFEST.in LICENSE requirements-dev.txt .github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml
git commit -m "Fix PyPI upload: Add platform-specific dependencies and modern packaging"
```

### 2. Create Release Tag
```bash
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin v1.1.0
```

### 3. Automatic Upload
- GitHub Actions will automatically trigger on tag push
- Workflow will test on multiple Python versions
- Package will be built and uploaded to PyPI using trusted publishing

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Platform Marker Syntax
```
pywin32>=306; sys_platform == "win32"
```
This ensures Windows-only dependencies are only installed on Windows systems.

### Entry Points Created
```
eve-crash-monitor=eve_crash_monitor:main
eve-crash-gui=crash_monitor_gui:main  
eve-monitor-auto=run_monitor_auto:main
```

### Package Metadata
- **Name**: `eve-crash-monitor`
- **Version**: `1.1.0`
- **License**: `MIT`
- **Python**: `>=3.8`
- **Platforms**: `Microsoft :: Windows` (primary), but compatible builds on all platforms

## âœ… Verification Complete

Your Eve Online Crash Monitor v1.1.0 is now properly configured for PyPI submission with cross-platform compatibility!

The key fix was adding platform-specific dependency markers, which resolves the original GitHub Actions error while maintaining full Windows functionality.
